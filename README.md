## About Me

_(Burn Notice narration voice) My name is Joe Potenza. I used to be a web developer, until ..._

From 2001 - 2016 I was a full-stack developer specializing in:
- Coldfusion
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- Amazon Web Services

My claim to fame was building a fantasy football empire. If you've ever played fantasy football, and you've used any tools to track your draft as it progresses, you've used a successor to my original tool called Draft Tracker for Fantasy Football Champs. I created a network of sites, interconnected by SSO including:
- Fantasy Football Champs
- Cold Hard Football Facts
- College Football Geek
- FFSlots
- Football Nation

That is, until my employer and I decided to part ways. I no longer wanted to write code and so I went into Retail Management until 2025.

Now, I'm back and taking the Software Engineering course at [TripleTen](https://www.tripleten.com) in order to get acquainted with modern development techniques and languages. I am refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to get back to doing what I've loved since I was 12 years old.
